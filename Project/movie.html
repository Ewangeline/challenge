                Rogue One was quite awesome, and quite different from the movies that came before. It was frightening, tense, very dark,
                VERY dirty (literally: maybe Mon Mothma was the only character without a layer of filth make-upped onto her face.
                And she looked so much like Mothma from ROTJ!) Some differences were somewhat striking, but overall it absolutely
                felt like a Star Wars movie should feel. Lots of familiar faces to see, super tense and exciting and beautiful.
                I was SO fortunate to be able to attend the premiere at the Pantages Saturday night, and can't wait to see it
                again Thursday night! There's never been a better time to be a Star Wars fan!

                I feel like the void left in my heart by episode VII has been filled now.

            </p>

            <p class="review-three">
                Maybe it's because I had higher expectations for episode VII and almost none for this one, I feel like this movie managed
                to achieve what the other one couldn't.

            </p>

                I'm not saying that it was perfect, but it sure was good enough for me, and it will be good enough for many other die-hard
                SW fans. Leading female actor wasn't that good in my opinion, but otherwise this movie had everything a SW fan
                could wish for. Good old characters, good old places, and an overall good old SW feeling. Fits into the story
                line quite well, CGI was a bold move , could've gone bad, but it played out quite nicely.

            </p>

        <p class="conclusion">
            Overall I think SW fans will love it, but anybody not deeply immersed in the saga would also enjoy it.
