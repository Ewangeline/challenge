            <h4p>Quick, spoiler-less thoughts from Hollywood Premiere Attendee</h4>

                <div class="box-review">
                    <p class="review-one">
                        Rogue One was quite awesome, and quite different from the movies that came before. It was frightening, tense, very dark,
                        VERY dirty (literally: maybe Mon Mothma was the only character without a layer of filth make-upped
                        onto her face. And she looked so much like Mothma from ROTJ!) Some differences were somewhat striking,
                        but overall it absolutely felt like a Star Wars movie should feel. Lots of familiar faces to see,
                        super tense and exciting and beautiful. I was SO fortunate to be able to attend the premiere at the
                        Pantages Saturday night, and can't wait to see it again Thursday night! There's never been a better
                        time to be a Star Wars fan!

                    </p>

                    <p class="review-two">
                        I feel like the void left in my heart by episode VII has been filled now.

                    </p>

                    <p class="review-three">
                        Maybe it's because I had higher expectations for episode VII and almost none for this one, I feel like this movie managed
                        to achieve what the other one couldn't.

                    </p>
                    <p class="review-four">
                        I'm not saying that it was perfect, but it sure was good enough for me, and it will be good enough for many other die-hard
                        SW fans. Leading female actor wasn't that good in my opinion, but otherwise this movie had everything
                        a SW fan could wish for. Good old characters, good old places, and an overall good old SW feeling.
                        Fits into the story line quite well, CGI was a bold move , could've gone bad, but it played out quite
                        nicely.

                    </p>
                </div>

                <p class="conclusion">
                    Overall I think SW fans will love it, but anybody not deeply immersed in the saga would also enjoy it.
